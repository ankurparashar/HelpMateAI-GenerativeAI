# HelpMateAI-GenerativeAI

This project focuses on building a generative search system in the insurance domain. Inspired by the approach demonstrated in the "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)" session, the goal is to design a system that can effectively and accurately answer questions derived from a policy document.

The project will utilize a single comprehensive life insurance policy document as the primary knowledge source. By leveraging retrieval and generation techniques, the system will ensure that user queries are grounded in the documentâ€™s content, providing precise and contextually relevant answers.
