# HelpMateAI-GenerativeAI

This project focuses on building a generative search system in the insurance domain. Inspired by the approach demonstrated in the "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)" session, the goal is to design a system that can effectively and accurately answer questions derived from a policy document.

The project will utilize a single comprehensive life insurance policy document as the primary knowledge source. By leveraging retrieval and generation techniques, the system will ensure that user queries are grounded in the document‚Äôs content, providing precise and contextually relevant answers.
